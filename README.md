# Gemkit

## Description

Gemkit is a JavaScript framework/library for building user interfaces fast.
It uses functional components with ESM imports and exports, making the code
readable and modern.

## Getting started

To create a new Gemkit app, you can use the CLI command:

```bash
npx create-gemkit-app@latest your-project
```

That will generate a starter folder structure with Vite, Tailwind and TypeScript
already integrated. After running the following commands:

```bash
cd your-project
npm install
```

your folder strucure should look like this:

```text
your-project/
    node_modules/
    package-lock.json
    package.json
    src/
        components/
            Counter.ts
        pages/
            Home.ts
            NotFound.ts
        App.ts
        main.ts
        index.css
    index.html
    tsconfig.json
    vite.config.js
```

## Development

Being able to view the webpage as you're building it is very important.
That's why Gemkit uses Vite Dev Server for fast hot reloads and quick
build time.

For development, run the dev command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

which will launch the Vite Dev Server on port 5173 (if available). You
can also use:

```bash
npm run preview
```

to see a preview of your web app from the `dist/` folder.

## Building for production

If your app is ready for production, you can use the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder, where you can find all your bundled
HTML/CSS/JS code, that you can deploy on any webhosting service (ex.
Vercel, Github Pages, Netlify).

## Key concepts

### ‚ö° Functional components

Gemkit uses functional components to build UI's like a house - brick by brick.

```ts
import { H1 } from 'gemkit/elements';

export default function HomePage() {

    return H1({
        children: ['This is my awesome app!']
    });
}
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom components

You can also create custom components and pass props to them. You
might want to consider using the global state manager to avoid prop
drilling.

```ts
import Foo from './components/Foo.ts';

export default function App() {

    return Foo({
        bar: 'baz'
    });
}
```

Then the Foo component:

```ts
import { H1 } from 'gemkit/elements';

export default function Foo({ bar }) {

    return H1({
        children: [bar]
    });
}
```

Gemkit also provides you with some built in components:

```ts
import { List } from 'gemkit/elements';

export default function App() {

    const todos = ['Go shopping', 'Do the dishes', 'Walk the dog'];

    return List({
        list: todos,
        fn: (todo, i) => Span({
            children: [todo],
            onClick: () => console.log(`${i}th todo`)
        })
    });
}
```

### üîÄ Hash router

Gemkit uses a hash routing system to allow routing on single page applications.

Use it as a return statement in your root (App) component. The Router takes
3 arguments:

1. Static routes
2. Dynamic routes
3. Fallback (not found)

```ts
import { HashRouter } from 'gemkit/router';
import Home from './pages/Home.ts';
import About from './pages/About.ts';
import User from './pages/User.ts';
import NotFound from './pages/NotFound.ts';

export default function App() {

    return HashRouter(
        {
            '/': Home,
            '/about': About
        },
        {
            '/user': User
        },
        NotFound
    );
}
```

With dynamic routes, the router will automaticly pass in the :id
as an argument.

For example, `https://www.yoursite.com/user/abcfoobarbazxyz`:

```ts
import { fetchUser } from '../lib/fetch.ts';
import { withState } from 'gemkit/hooks';
import { H1 } from 'gemkit/elements';

export default function User(uid) {

    const [user, setUser] = withState<Record<string, any>>('user', null);

    withEffect(() => {
        fetchUser(uid).then(setUser);
    }, [uid]);

    return H1({
        children: user ? [`Welcome, ${user}!`] : ['Loading...']
    });
}
```

### ü™ù Hooks

#### withState

All state is stored in a global object. You can have state
in your application by using the `withState` hook, which
takes 2 arguments:

1. Key (unique identifier)
2. Initial value

`withState` is also a generic function, which means you can type
your return values for better type safety.

The hook then returns an array with 2 values, where the 1st one
is the value and the 2nd is the setter function. Use the setter
function to update the value, never modify the value on it's own.

You can access a global state by using the same key (to avoid prop
drilling), or create a new one by using a unique key.

Keep in mind, that updating the state rerenders the whole application,
not just the component. All code inside a component (like the `console.log`
below) will execute on every rerender.

```ts
import { withState } from 'gemkit/hooks';
import { Button } from 'gemkit/elements';

export default function Counter() {

    const [count, setCount] = withState<number>('count', 0);

    console.log(`Count: ${count}`);

    return Button({
        children: ['Increment'],
        onClick: () => setCount(count + 1)
    });
}
```

#### withEffect

Effects are callback functions that get re-executed, when a certain state changes.
You can achive this by using the `withEffect` hook, which takes 2 arguments:

1. Callback (the function you want to re-execute)
2. Dependency array

The callback is of type `() => void`. The dependency array should contain all your
dependent variables (states). When any one of these variables change, the callback
gets re-executed. You can put whatever you want to execute on every re-render outside
the hook.

#### withRef

The `withRef` hook is used to get a reference. In the example below, we're using it to
get the uncontrolled input's value. `withRef` returns an object:

```ts
{ current: null }
```

which you can modify with the `ref.current` property.

```ts
import { withState, withRef } from 'gemkit/hooks';
import { Div, H3, Input, Button } from 'gemkit/elements';

export default function InputPage() {

    const [text, setText] = withState<string>('');
    const inputRef = withRef<HTMLInputElement>();

    return Div({
        children: [
            H3({ children: [text] }),
            Input({
                ref: inputRef,
                type: 'text',
                placeholder: 'Enter some text...'
            }),
            Button({
                children: ['Display input'],
                onClick: () => setText(inputRef.current?.value ?? '')
            })
        ]
    })
}
```

## Tips

### Use ternary operators

For conditional rendering, you can just simply use ternaries, like
in this example:

```ts
import { H1 } from 'gemkit/elements';
import { isLoading, content } from './lib/util.ts';

export default function App() {

    return H1({
        children: isLoading ? ['Loading...'] : [content]
    });
}
```
